# WebFileManager.NET

Web File Manager is an application that allows me to internally browse my file system and edit/view files. I wrote this initially in Python using the Flask framework (see https://github.com/gmancoder/WebFileManager) but then ported it to .NET using C# with MVC 5 for my Windows Server.
